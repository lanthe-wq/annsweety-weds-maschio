    //     as a Script Property inside the Apps Script, and the check happens
    //     on Google's servers. That passcode is NOT in this file and NOT
    //     visible in page source;

    //     Export to Excel (.xlsx) and CSV.
    //
    // There is deliberately no passcode in this file. Everything here is
    // served to every visitor and is readable with "View source", so a
    // passcode stored here would not be a secret. With backendUrl blank the
    // site still collects RSVPs (saved on the guest's own device) but the
    // dashboard stays locked, rather than being guarded by a published code.
